## Background
In discussing the [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) problem with a friend as one of the most basic examples of recursion, I wanted to visualize the solution. Checkout `simple` branch for the original barebones approach; this branch will include slightly more best practices & features.
