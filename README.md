# Simple Tower of Hanoi
## Background
In discussing the [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) problem with a friend as one of the most basic examples of recursion, I wanted to visualize the solution. Keeps the methods/markup as simple as possible, while generating solution visualizations for towers of any height from 1-20.
